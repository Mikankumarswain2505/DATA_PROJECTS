# DATA_EXCEL_DASHBOARD

 **Data Analysis Dashboard â€“ Excel-Based Sales Performance Tracker**

I developed this interactive **Excel Dashboard** to analyze and visualize sales performance across multiple regions including Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, and more.

 **Key Features:**

* Region-wise filter buttons for dynamic views
* Top-performing **Sales Executives** with total sales metrics
* Visualizations using **bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs**
* Segmented dashboards showing:

  * Total Sales
  * Target Achievement %
  * Gap from Sales Targets

ðŸ›  **Tools Used:**

* Microsoft Excel (Formulas, PivotTables, Charts)
* Conditional Formatting
* Dashboard Design with Button Controls

 This project helped in **simplifying sales insights**, identifying performance trends, and supporting **data-driven decisions** â€” all within Excel.
